#Next Steps

#Integrate live Chainlink / TWAP oracle feeds.

#Connect RL agent to optimize allocations dynamically.

#Extend for live fund management after shadow testing.

## Overview

This system is a **multi-chain AI Treasury Agent** that:

1. Simulates LP allocations across Ethereum, Polygon, and Hedera.
2. Uses **Bayesian scores and RL agent** for dynamic decision making.
3. Protects against low liquidity and low reputation pools.
4. Shadow-mode safe: no real funds used.

## Components

- **main.py**: Engine that updates pool states, performs LP allocation calculations, and saves pool data to JSON.
- **dashboard/dashboard.py**: Dash web app that reads pool data JSON and visualizes LP allocations, pool scores, ROI, impermanent loss, fees, and TWAP deviations.
- **core/rebalancer.py**: Implements the rebalancing logic, RL + Bayesian score adjustments.
- **execution/dex_interface.py**: Placeholder for DEX execution (Uniswap, SushiSwap, HederaDEX) and Hedera settlement functions.
- **execution/rl_agent.py**: Reinforcement learning agent code.
- **pool_data.json**: Auto-generated file shared between engine and dashboard.

## Shadow Mode Workflow

1. `main.py` runs in a loop (every 5 seconds).  
2. Calculates LP allocations and pool scores.  
3. Prints shadow allocation logs to terminal.  
4. Saves `pool_data.json`.  
5. Dashboard reads JSON, updates charts in real-time.

## Future Extensions

- Integrate **live oracle feeds** (Chainlink / TWAP) for price-based risk adjustment.  
- Connect to **real LP execution** for live treasury operations.  
- Add **alert notifications** for high-risk conditions or unexpected fees.  
- Expand dashboard with **historical charts**, ROI heatmaps, and scenario simulation.
